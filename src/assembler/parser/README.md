# VTX1 Assembler Parser Module

This directory contains components for syntax analysis and parsing for the VTX1 assembly language.

## Purpose

The parser is responsible for:
- Processing the token stream from the lexer
- Building an abstract syntax tree (AST)
- Validating syntax and instruction formats
- Handling VLIW instruction grouping
- Managing symbol definitions and references

## Implementation

The parser will implement a recursive descent approach to process the assembly language grammar.
