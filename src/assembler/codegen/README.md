# VTX1 Assembler Code Generation Module

This directory contains components for generating binary machine code from parsed assembly instructions.

## Purpose

The code generator is responsible for:
- Converting parsed instructions into binary machine code
- Implementing the VTX1 instruction encoding format
- Resolving symbol references and calculating addresses
- Handling balanced ternary literal encoding
- Managing VLIW instruction packing

## Implementation

The code generator will implement the VTX1 96-bit VLIW instruction format with support for all 78 instructions in the architecture.
