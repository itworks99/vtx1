== Introduction

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the VTX1 assembler, which is designed to convert assembly language code into binary machine code for the VTX1 ternary processor.

The VTX1 assembler supports the complete instruction set of the VTX1 architecture, including VLIW operations with parallel execution capabilities, balanced ternary numeric representation, and various addressing modes.
