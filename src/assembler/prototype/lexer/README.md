# VTX1 Assembler Lexer Module

This directory contains components for lexical analysis and tokenization for the VTX1 assembly language.

## Purpose

The lexer is responsible for:
- Breaking input text into meaningful tokens
- Classifying tokens (mnemonics, registers, literals, etc.)
- Handling balanced ternary literals
- Tracking source line information for error reporting

## Implementation

The lexer will be implemented using a stream-based approach to efficiently process assembly source files.
